# Code of Conduct

In this piece of paper we will talk about the code of conduct of the project. We will talk about the relation between the team member.
The Code of Conduct is version 1.0.0. Please check JANDI for the older version.
Now let's dive in the human aspect of a project. It's maybe the most underrated aspect of a project but it's the most important one.

### Respect
Respect is the most important thing in a group. If you don't respect your team member, you will not be able to work with them. So please, respect everyone. It's not because you don't like someone that you can't work with them. You can work with everyone, you just need to respect them. No matter the situation, respect is the key. We are all human, we all make mistakes. So please, respect everyone. But we still allow you to make jokes and have fun with your team member. But please, don't be mean and don't go to hard on someone.

### Help
As a team, we win together, we loose together. So when you need help, when you are not sure about something, ask for help. Don't be scared to ask for help. It's not because you ask for help that you are not good enough. It's because you want to learn and you want to do it right. So please, ask for help when you need it. And when someone ask for help, please help them. It's not because you know something that everyone know it. So please, help your team member when they need it. When you help someone, you learn something too. So it's a win-win situation.
Remember the respect part, if you don't respect someone, you will not help them. So please, respect everyone.
Go ask other if they need help, they may be scared to ask for help, but be respectful when you do so.

### Interest
When you work on a project you need to be interested by the project. We know that some project does not deeply interest you, but at least be intersted by the team success.

### Mature
We are all adults don't be a douchbag and act like a child. When we are in a debate or in a discussion, we are all allowed to have our own opinion. But please, don't be a douchbag and respect the other opinion. If you don't agree with someone, explain why you don't agree with them. Don't just say "No, you are wrong". Explain why you don't agree with them.
And if you don't have any argument to explain why you don't agree with them, maybe you should think about it and maybe you will change your mind. But please, don't be a douchbag and respect the other opinion.

## Project steps
Now let's talk about the project steps. We will talk about the daily and the meeting.

### Daily
The daily is a meeting where everyone will say what they did yesterday, what they will do today and if they have any problem. It's a really important meeting because it will help everyone to know what the other are doing. It will help to avoid some conflict and some misunderstanding. It's a really important meeting, so please, be there. If you can't be there, please tell it to your team member. It's not because you are not there that you don't have to do the daily. You can do it on Discord. But please, do it. It's really important.

### Meeting
Everyone in the group can summon a meeting. But please, don't summon a meeting for nothing. If you want to summon a meeting, please explain why you want to summon a meeting. What is the goal of the meeting.
Then when the meeting will take place, we will define some roles:
- Time keeper: The time keeper will be in charge of the time. He will make sure that the meeting will not take too much time. He will make sure that everyone will have the same amount of time to talk.
- Scriber: The scriber will be in charge of taking notes during the meeting. He will take notes about what is said during the meeting. He will take notes about the decision taken during the meeting. He will take notes about the next meeting.
- Decision pusher: The decision pusher will be in charge of pushing the decision taken during the meeting if needed.
- Moderator: The moderator will be in charge of the meeting. He will make sure that everyone will be able to talk. He will make sure that everyone will respect the rules. He will make sure that everyone will be able to express their opinion. He will make sure that everyone will be able to talk about what they want to talk about.

When the meeting is over, the scriber will upload the note to JANDI.
