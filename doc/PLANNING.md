# Scrum Planning - AREA

## Brief introduction to Scrum

Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks, then track progress and re-plan in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called daily scrums.
Since everybody must code, we won't have a product owner. The client will be the product owner.

## Scrum main events

- **Sprint Planning**: The team meets with the product owner to discuss the backlog and to decide which items will be included in the sprint.
- **Daily Scrum**: The team meets every day for a 15-minute meeting to discuss the progress of the sprint.
- **Sprint Review**: The team meets with the product owner to discuss the progress of the sprint and to present the work done.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: The team meets to discuss the sprint and to identify what went well and what could be improved.

## Scrum main roles

- **Scrum Master**: The scrum master is responsible for ensuring that the team is following the scrum process. The scrum master is also responsible for removing any impediments that are preventing the team from achieving their sprint goals.
- **Development Team**: The development team is responsible for developing the product. The development team is also responsible for estimating the effort required to complete each item in the backlog.

## Scrum main artifacts

- **Product Backlog**: The product backlog is a list of all the features that need to be implemented in the product. The product backlog is maintained by the product owner.
- **Sprint Backlog**: The sprint backlog is a list of all the features that need to be implemented in the current sprint. The sprint backlog is maintained by the development team.
- **Burndown Chart**: The burndown chart is a graph that shows the progress of the sprint. The burndown chart is maintained by the scrum master.
